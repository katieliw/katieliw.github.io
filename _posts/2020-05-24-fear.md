Something I recently realized is that fear often holds me back. It's what causes a lot of the hesitation I have. Fear of pain, fear of disappointment or disappointing others, fear of failure, fear of making mistakes or hurting others.. the list could go on. But with the realization that this is what holds me back, I've also realized that I don't want this fear to stop me. If I'm always scared, I'll never end up doing anything and that's no way to live.
