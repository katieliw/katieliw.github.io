Something I recently realized is that fear often holds me back. It's what causes a lot of the hesitation I have. Fear of pain, fear of disappointment or disappointing others, fear of failure, fear of making mistakes or hurting others.. the list could go on. And very closely related to that is uncertainty. I'm never sure what is or isn't the right decision and I'm scared of being wrong and making the incorrect choice. But with the realization that this is what holds me back, I've also realized that I don't want this fear to stop me. If I'm always scared, I'll never end up doing anything and that's no way to live. So, I've decided I want to try my best to stop letting things hold me back.

During this time with a global pandemic affecting everyone's lives, I think it's fair to say that there's been a general rise in fear and uncertainty, leading to higher levels of stress and anxiety for everyone. Some of it is directly related to the pandemic and some of it isn't, but as things get better in BC, I think people are learning to cope with and alleviate these feelings, or at the very least reduce the levels at which they're felt.

No one knows what'll happen from here on out but my goal is to positively change the things I can control. Here's hoping to a brighter second half of 2020.
