If you've found yourself here then perhaps you'd like to know just a bit more about *me*. I consider myself to be a pretty happy, cheerful, curious person as well as fairly easy-going. I think my friends would agree, but if you don't know me, I guess you'd have to be the judge of whether or not that's true. Some of my **interests** include:
```
- fashion
- hiking (I mean, I live in BC after all)
- tv shows (more on this later..)
- movies
- running
- exploring (vague, I know, but you can ask me for clarification by reaching out!)
```
I really like fashion because I do think it's a way to express yourself and I'm always looking for new inspiration. I find that if you look good, you feel good, as shallow as that may sound. But if you feel good, I think it's a boost in self-confidence which can't be a bad thing - at least in moderation.

I have yet to find a hike that I liked better and that felt more rewarding than hiking Garibaldi Lake with my sister several years ago. The view at the top was just absolutely breathtaking and made the hike totally worth it. BC is **the** best place to live if you enjoy being outdoors, I swear and there are just so many more hikes and places in general left in the province for me to explore! (The background photo at the top of my homepage was actually taken there - as was the one below this paragraph.)

My favourite show is **Brooklyn Nine-Nine**, but I've also (binge) watched tons of others like Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, You, The Vampire Diaries, Modern Family, Grey's Anatomy, Flashpoint, The 100 - some of which are better than others... Some started out great and then went downhill, but often times, I finished the series anyway just because I'd made it so far already.

There's always more to learn about someone (and yourself) but that's all I'll say about myself for now.
