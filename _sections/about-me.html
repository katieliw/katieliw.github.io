<p>My name's <b>Katie</b> and I was born and raised in <b>Vancouver, BC</b>. I'm a recent graduate as part of the UBC class of 2020, having completed my Bachelor's Degree in the Faculty of Science - major in computer science. Since entering university, I've met so many different people and learned so many things that have had a profound impact on my life and who I am today. I'm grateful to have made new connections and I hope to keep doing so long beyond graduation. I find that I'm still constantly learning more about myself, the world and others as each day passes. My experiences have helped shape who I am and I hope any future opportunities I have will continue to help me grow as a person as well as nurture my aspirations and goals. At this time, I've realized that I enjoy being in the <b>tech space</b> and I really value <b>human connection</b>, <b>inclusivity</b> and <b>achieving happiness</b> (as vague as "happiness" may be). I know that there's always room for improvement and I'm always striving to be better. I hope to find a role where I'm able to make the best use of my skills and continue to grow as well as have a positive impact on those around me. As I go through life, I'm excited to see what may come, how I change, what I learn and how I can help others. </p>
